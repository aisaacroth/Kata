SequenceSum

##Description##
###SUm of 'n' Numbers###
`sum_of_n` (or `SequenceSum.sumOfN` in Java) takes an integer `n` and returns
a `List` of length abs(n) + 1. The `List` contains the numbers in the
arithmetic series produced by taking the sum of consecutive integer numbers
from 0 to n inclusive.

- `n` can also be 0 or a negative value.

Example:

`5` -> `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15]`  
`7` -> `[0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 21, 28]`
